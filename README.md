### What is this?

This is a copy of my scripts, makefiles, and config files I reference in this blog post:

[https://mzfit.app/blog/the_one_where_i_tune_my_cdcd_pipeline/](https://mzfit.app/blog/the_one_where_i_tune_my_cdcd_pipeline/)

This is completely unsuitable for cloning and running with.  

- none of my scripts have much error handling
- I've scrubbed some of my project specific items, so these scripts may not even actually work.
- I'm not at all sure my github actions config does things well. In particular, exporting github secrets to be environment variables may be a horrible idea.

This is here in case you read my blog post and want to see how I did things.  If you don't understand something, please don't use it until you do understand it well enough to see its shortcomings.

Also, I moved the .github actions out of a .github directory for visibility and to make sure they don't run on this repo.
